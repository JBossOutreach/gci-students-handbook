# JBoss Google Code In Student Handbook

Thank you for participating in Google Code In with JBoss!
We are really excited to have you :)


Before you begin with tasks, let's go over some information which is crucial.

## Requirements

- Make sure you signed up to [Google Code In](https://codein.withgoogle.com/)
- Make sure you signed up to [Github](https://github.com) as we are going to use it for all kind of coding work. It is also necessary for Gitter (details below).
- Also read how Git and Github works. [Here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is a good document for that. You can also try [the Git tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1), an interactive tutorial to learn Git in 15 minutes by GitHub.


## Communication

We're here to help you!

While you can post your queries related to your task directly on the GCI web portal, we recommend using [Gitter](https://gitter.im/JBossOutreach/gci) to contact mentors.

Use the public channel `JBossOutreach/gci` for asking questions, instead of finding mentors there and asking privately. This way, you would also help other students who have the same problems, which is the open source way! (we are aware that GCI is a contest, but your efforts that help others won't be unnoticed by the mentors and GCI admins).

Your friendly mentors will be around in that channel to answer any questions you may have.

Quick note, it is considered a good practice to use Google before contacting mentors, as many problems you encounter will have been solved on the web.

For any troubles you're having with the organization, mentors or other students, feel free to contact the GCI admins (details below).

## Github Repositories

We created forks of the relevant projects in [JBossOutreach](https://github.com/JBossOutreach) Github organization. 

We ask you to send your pull requests (PRs) to the forks there. This way, we can merge your PRs to the clones and later on the project owners can merge your code back to the original repositories.
